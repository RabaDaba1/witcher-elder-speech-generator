# Elder Speech vocabulary
The Elder Speech is based heavily on the Celtic languages of Wales, Ireland, and Scotland, although in some cases Sapkowski has used also connotations with more "popular" languages, like German and English.. The vocabulary is not very large, with 378 unique words. The grammar is very flexible, and the word order is not fixed. The language is very poetic, and it is used in poetry, songs, and spells. It is also used in everyday speech, but it is not very common. It is used by elves, dryads, sirens and nereids. It is also used by humans, but only by those who are interested in magic and poetry. The language is not used by dwarves, gnomes, halflings, and other non-magical creatures.
